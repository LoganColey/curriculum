# Independent Thesis Unit Plan

## Overview

The goal of this unit is to train students to independently develop and drive towards their technical and career goals. Over the course of the unit we will work with students to develop mental models and habits for identifying, prioritizing, and acting upon their growth opportunities. A student is successful in this unit if they complete an independent thesis project designed to advance a specific, technical skill.

## Timeline

### Summary

Start - March 31

End - End of School Year

At the beginning of the unit, the total expectation for the unit is communicated to the students. With instructor guidance, students will determine the specific, technical skill that they wish to advance and an acceptable, thesis deliverable.

Weekly, students will submit a brief report every Friday on the progress they have made during the week.

Weekly, students will develop and deliver a seven minute presentation on a selection of the content they are learning.

At the end of the unit, students will submit their agreed upon thesis deliverable.

## Benchmarking and Feedback

### Weekly Report

Students will submit a brief report every Friday on the progress they have made during the week. The report must sufficiently defend that the week was well spent.

**Students will know they are successful** when instructors take no issue with their report.

**Students will know how to improve** by instructors highlighting poorly spent time during the week or lack of description in the report. For example, a student could fail to report that they completed a significant work. Also, a student could get stuck on a topic and fail to problem solve around the issue or reach out for help.

### Technical Presentation

Students will develop and deliver a seven minute presentation on a selection of the content they are learning. Peers will review the presentations based on delivery. Instructors will review the presentations based on delivery and technical accuracy.

**Students will know they are successful** when they receive satisfactory marks from instructors.

**Students will know how to improve** through technical and presentation feedback provided by instructors and peers.

### Thesis Project

Students will submit an agreed upon thesis project that provides evidence of satisfactory advancement in their agreed upon specific, technical skill.

**Students will know they are successful** when they complete and submit their project in a satisfactory state.

**Students will know how to improve** through instructors identifying ways that the project submission does not comply with the agreed upon description of the thesis project.
