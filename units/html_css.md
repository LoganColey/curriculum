# HTML/CSS Unit Plan

## Timeline

### Summary

Start - August 5

End - September 13

We started splitting days into Python mornings and HTML/CSS afternoons in August. We'll be doing HTML/CSS full-time in September.

### Week-by-Week

#### Week of August 5

Introduce HTML/CSS and edit a template from html5up to produce their first attempt at a personal page. The goal of this week is to motivate and give the student a sense of what kind of work they will be doing with HTML/CSS.

#### Week of August 12

Learn HTML/CSS basics with freecodecamp.org.

#### Week of August 19

Build and publish first portfolio (based on template) to GitHub Pages.

#### Week of August 26

Recreate components from existing websites (one per day) and publish them on codepen.

#### Week of September 2

Recreate page layouts from existing websites (one per day) and publish them on codepen. Learn CSS Flexbox via lecture and freecodecamp.

#### Week of September 9

Create static, small business website from scratch as a class assignment. Benchmark: Independently create a static, small business website from scratch.

## Benchmarking and Feedback

### freecodecamp

We set a goal of having an established portion of the website finished by a fixed date. Each day we reminded the students of that goal to help them understand whether or not they were on track. For in-exercise feedback, the website's exercises are built around granular lessons accompanied by test suites.

### Portfolio

Students have a pretty strong built-in incentive to drive quality on their own portfolios. On top of this, we work with the students from a copywriting and technical perspective through 1-on-1 guidance and referencing existing portfolio websites on the internet.

### Recreation Exercises

Every recreation exercise starts by working a solution in front of the class to highlight workflow and relevant HTML/CSS. About half-way through the exercise I rework again from scratch, but this time I highlight the areas where students are seen struggling. At the end of the exercise, I rework it one last time in front of the class and ask questions to lead the students into future exercise. For example, students may not know a few css properties relevant to a particular exercise. We would call out those properties and talk about ways to learn those specific properties better.

### Static, Small Business Website

Similar to the recreation exercises, we will work through a significant portion of the assignment in front of the class with the same start-middle-end flow. During this time we will point back to layout and component techniques practiced in previous sections.
