# Full Stack Group Project Unit Plan

## Overview

The goal of this unit is to transition the students into a more realistic work environment and expose them to a variety of concepts and practices by shipping real software to real users.

The class will be broken down into product teams responsible for delivering a set of functionality inside a suite of internal tools at BCCA. The month will be run using agile methodologies. Students will participate in: daily standup, task coordination with a kanban board, 1-week sprints, fork-based git workflows, code review, and continuous integration and deployment. Mondays will involve a brief sprint planning and teams are responsible for completing the sprint by Friday. Friday will involve a brief sprint retrospective to discuss.

## Timeline

### Summary

Start - December 2

End - December 20

### Week-by-Week

#### Week of December 2

This week is an onboarding week. Students get oriented to their team's responsibility and the expected workflow. Teams completed a lighter sprint designed to ensure that they are comfortable with the required workflow.

#### Week of December 9

Students participate in all of the practices listed above to complete another sprint. The goal for this sprint focuses on feature development instead of onboarding.

#### Week of December 16

Students participate in one last sprint focusing on responding to user feedback about existing features.

## Benchmarking and Feedback

### Pull Request Review

Each team will submit code via a Pull Request. Each Pull request must: pass manual code review, not have linter violations, pass the test suite, and maintain test coverage. If a team's PR doesn't pass these checks, they must respond appropriately to the requirements.

### Sprint Retrospective

Students will participate in a weekly sprint retrospective to discuss: what went well, what could be better, what changes we will commit to for the next sprint. The week following each retro will include daily checks for the agreed upon changes.

### Peer-to-Peer Feedback

Students will complete a weekly form measuring their performance and their pair's performance along the following dimensions: technical, collaboration, culture. These forms will be incorporated into weekly, student-specific coaching.
