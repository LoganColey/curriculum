# Server-Rendered Back End Development Fundamentals Unit Plan

## Timeline

### Summary

Start - October 21

End - November 15

### Week-by-Week

#### Week of October 21

Further develop existing understanding of HTTP through hand writing small HTTP requests/responses. Connect those ideas to Django by writing simple Django Views. Outline minimal Django forms handling via request.GET/POST. Introduce form validation via Django Forms.

#### Week of October 28

Introduce basic Relational Database concepts: tables, rows, columns, keys. Introduce Django ORM and exercise constructing and using unrelated tables.

#### Week of November 4

Introduce and exercise one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

#### Week of November 11

Benchmark: Build backend for provided starter django project. The starter will provide all non-backend concerns.

## Benchmarking and Feedback

### Target Practices

After concepts are introduced, we will have have various, timeboxed, contextless exercises for the students to get exercise. The current planned target practice exercises are for: Django Views, Django Forms, unrelated Django Models, and related Django Models.

### Projects with a Missing Piece

Students will complete a project that has an appropriately missing piece. For Django Views+Forms they will implement the views and forms that appropriately recieve and validate data to be used with provided functionality. For Django Models, they will be required to implement Model functionality to be used by existing functionality.

### Benchmark Project

The students will be referred to a github repository that is completely implemented with the exception of Django backend concerns. The project will contain documentation on: data structures are expected by the templates, endpoints expected by the frontend.
