# Java Unit Plan

## Overview

The goal of this unit is to transition the students existing programming abilities into a Java development environment. Additionally, this unit introduces a novel increase in student responsibility for their learning. A student is successful in this unit if they are capable of solving coding challenges and writing terminal applications with Java.

Students are provided benchmark exercises and coaching to help direct their learning, but day is mostly spent self-directed. This is done to prepare the students for the real world experience of learning a technology on the job where developers are expected to get up to speed with technology relevant to their job with minimal handholding from their manager.

## Timeline

### Summary

Start - January 2
End - February 4

At the beginning of the unit, the total expectation for the unit is communicated to the students. Students attempt a benchmark assignment each Friday afternoon. The month will cover the chapters of Head First Java listed below.

#### Week of Jan 6

1. Dive in A Quick Dip: Breaking the Surface
2. Classes and Objects: A Trip to Objectville
3. Primitives and References: Know Your Variables

#### Week of Jan 13

4. Methods Use Instance Variables: How Objects Behave
5. Writing a Program: Extra-Strength Methods
6. Get to Know the Java API: Using the Java Library

#### Week of Jan 20

7. Inheritance and Polymorphism: Better Living in Objectville
8. Interfaces and Abstract Classes: Serious Polymorphism
9. Constructors and Garbage Collection: Life and Death of an Object

#### Week of Jan 27

10. Numbers and Statics: Numbers Matter
11. Exception Handling: Risky Behavior
12. Serialization and File I/O: Saving Objects

#### Week of Feb 3

13. Collections and Generics: Data structures

## Benchmarking and Feedback

### Chapter "CliffsNotes" Summary

Students will synthesize and submit 1 page "CliffsNotes" summary on each chapter covered. Students will submit drafts to instructors and peers for review. Each summary will center around explaining a small application that represents the chapter's content. The application must sufficiently represent the chapter (no important concepts omitted), and the summary must sufficiently explain the application (no important constructs ignored).

**Students will know they are successful** when peers and instructors find no serious flaws with their summary.

**Students will know how to improve** by peers and instructors identifying omitted concepts or ignored programming constructs.

### Benchmark Assignment

Students will attempt a benchmark assignment each Friday afternoon. The benchmarks represent satisfactory competency of the unit and exercise the following areas:

- Fundamental Data Types and Control Flow
- Input Validation
- File Input/Output
- Exceptions
- JSON Serialization/Deserialization
- Java Collections
- Generics
- Object Oriented Programming

**Students will know they are successful** when they complete a benchmark attempt.

**Students will know how to improve** through differentiated instruction, exercise, and feedback based on struggles during benchmark attempts.
