# Spring & SQL Unit Plan

## Overview

The goal of this unit is to transition the students web development abilities with Django to Spring through API development. Additionally, this unit will use raw SQL for database access instead of an ORM. A student is successful in this unit if they are capable of developing APIs using Java, Spring, and SQL.

Students are provided benchmark exercises and coaching to help direct their learning, but the day is mostly spent self-directed. This is done to prepare the students for the real world experience of learning a technology on the job where developers are expected to get up to speed with technology relevant to their job with minimal handholding from their manager.

Students will be provided video recordings of solving benchmark assignments to study ([benefits of studying worked examples](https://openlearning.mit.edu/mit-faculty/research-based-learning-findings/worked-and-faded-examples)).

## Timeline

### Summary

Start - February 5

End - March 27

At the beginning of the unit, the total expectation for the unit is communicated to the students. Students attempt a benchmark assignment each Friday afternoon. Students will learn the topics outlined below. In order to leverage the [benefits of spaced and interleaved learning](https://openlearning.mit.edu/mit-faculty/research-based-learning-findings/spaced-and-interleaved-practice), Spring and SQL coverage will occur in parallel and cumulative quizzes will be administered weekly.

- Spring
  - Creating and building projects with Spring Boot
  - Creating Rest Controllers in Spring MVC
  - Validating Request JSON
  - Database Management with JDBC
  - Securing Applications with Spring Security
- SQL
  - Creating Tables
  - Column Types
  - Inserting/Updating/Deleting Data
  - Basic Queries
  - Related Tables
  - Inner Joins
  - Left/Right/Full Joins
  - Constraints: Check, NOT NULL, Foreign Key, Primary Key, Unique

## Benchmarking and Feedback

### Concept "CliffsNotes" Summary

Students will synthesize and submit 1 page "CliffsNotes" summary on each concept listed above. Students will submit drafts to instructors and peers for review. Each summary will center around explaining a small application (or code snippet) that represents the concept. The application must sufficiently represent the concept, and the summary must sufficiently explain the application.

**Students will know they are successful** when peers and instructors find no serious flaws with their summary.

**Students will know how to improve** by peers and instructors identifying omitted concepts or ignored programming constructs.

### Benchmark Assignment

Students will attempt a benchmark assignment where they develop a Spring API each Friday afternoon. The benchmarks represent satisfactory competency of the unit and exercise the areas listed above.

**Students will know they are successful** when they complete a benchmark attempt.

**Students will know how to improve** through differentiated instruction and exercise based on struggles during benchmark attempts.
