## Benchmarking and Feedback

### Please Don't Forget

The assignment comes with screenshots of what the end result should look like. Additionally, the Walkthrough -> Pair -> Solo workflow presents opportunities to fine tune work done by students.

### Components with JS

Walkthrough -> Pair -> Solo increasingly clarifies and fine tunes expectations for students. All of the components are very well known components with plenty of prior art. We will look a number of UI toolkits to clarify expectations.

### Benchmark Project

The students will be referred to a github repository that is completely implemented with the exception of HTML/CSS/JS. The project will contain a test suite to clarify expectations and help the gauge progress. The project will also contain documentation on what data structures are provided to the templates.
